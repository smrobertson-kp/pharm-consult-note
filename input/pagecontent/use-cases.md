The consultant pharmacist role is critical to the management of patients in long term care settings by providing clinical review and medication reconciliation upon admission/readmission/discharge. The consultant pharmacist provides a monthly regimen review of the efficacy and appropriateness of the medications and the overall treatment plan. They serve as a bridge between the facility medical staff (nursing and physician) and the pharmacy. The following use cases demonstrate examples of consultant pharmacist’s activities and clinical documentation.

### Use Case 1 - Pharmacist's Monthly SNF Visit

The consultant pharmacist during the monthly visit to the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) reviews the patient’s chart of an 85 year old female with diagnosis of psychosis and performs an MRR noting the resident is on Seroquel 50mg at bedtime. The consultant pharmacist reviews the notes for targeted behavior and observes the patient is showing signs of oversedation. The consultant pharmacist writes a recommendation to the prescriber to reduce the Seroquel dose to 25mg at bedtime and continue to monitor for side effects. (Recommendation is “dose reduction”, reported using Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine [SNOMED CT] Code.)

The consultant pharmacist captures information from the patient’s chart, or if electronic, the facility’s Electronic Health Record (EHR)/Electronic Medical Record (EMR) (e.g., medication orders, lab orders, progress notes, medication administration record, or targeted facility report). This information is entered or transported into the consultant pharmacist’s software. The consultant pharmacist generates the Consult Note, which is sent to the physician and/or nursing facility’s system. The physician responds by accepting or rejecting with comments using a response Consult Note. The responses to the recommendations are tracked in the consultant pharmacist software. As a result of the consult note exchange, the information is available for outcomes reporting.
